# Skittles Task Environment

Repository for a Unity implementation of the "skittles" virtual throwing task originally proposed in (Müller & Sternad, 2004), and more recently used in Zhang et al. (2018). This environment is designed to be used with a computer mouse to facilitate remote data collection or prototyping.
